	abstract = {The ability to easily and efficiently analyse {RNA}-sequencing data is a key strength of the Bioconductor project. Starting with counts summarised at the gene-level, a typical analysis involves pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, differential expression testing and pathway analysis with the results obtained informing future experiments and validation studies. In this workflow article, we analyse {RNA}-sequencing data from the mouse mammary gland, demonstrating use of the popular
              {edgeR}
              package to import, organise, filter and normalise the data, followed by the
              limma
              package with its
              voom
              method, linear modelling and empirical Bayes moderation to assess differential expression and perform gene set testing. This pipeline is further enhanced by the
              Glimma
              package which enables interactive exploration of the results so that individual samples and genes can be examined by the user. The complete analysis offered by these three packages highlights the ease with which researchers can turn the raw counts from an {RNA}-sequencing experiment into biological insights using Bioconductor.},

	abstract = {Human lung epithelial cells are likely among the first targets to encounter invading severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus ({SARS}-{CoV}). Not only can these cells support the growth of {SARS}-{CoV} infection, but they are also capable of secreting inflammatory cytokines to initiate and, eventually, aggravate host innate inflammatory responses, causing detrimental immune-mediated pathology within the lungs. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the complex epithelial signaling to {SARS}-{CoV} is crucial for paving the way to better understand {SARS} pathogenesis. Based on microarray-based functional genomics, we report here the global gene response of 2B4 cells, a cloned bronchial epithelial cell line derived from Calu-3 cells. Specifically, we found a temporal and spatial activation of nuclear factor ({NF})κB, activator protein ({AP})-1, and interferon regulatory factor ({IRF})-3/7 in infected 2B4 cells at 12-, 24-, and 48-hrs post infection (p.i.), resulting in the activation of many antiviral genes, including interferon ({IFN})-β, -λs, inflammatory mediators, and many {IFN}-stimulated genes ({ISGs}). We also showed, for the first time, that {IFN}-β and {IFN}-λs were capable of exerting previously unrecognized, non-redundant, and complementary abilities to limit {SARS}-{CoV} replication, even though their expression could not be detected in infected 2B4 bronchial epithelial cells until 48 hrs p.i. Collectively, our results highlight the mechanics of the sequential events of antiviral signaling pathway/s triggered by {SARS}-{CoV} in bronchial epithelial cells and identify novel cellular targets for future studies, aiming at advancing strategies against {SARS}.},
